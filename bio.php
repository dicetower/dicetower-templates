<p>Hi, my name is Tom Vasel, host of The Dice Tower.&nbsp; I've played board games most of my life, having learned classics such as Uno!, Monopoly, Sorry!, and Careers as a child.&nbsp; I quickly started looking through thrift stores to find more and more games, and was captivated by games that had variety and strategy, such as Cosmic Encounter and Scotland Yard.</p>
<p>In college, I played quite a few collectible card games, and dabbled with wargames and miniatures.&nbsp; Over the past five years, however, I've become aware of a great amount of other board games.&nbsp; Many of these games are known as &quot;Eurogames&quot;, due to the prolific nature of the German and French game designers.&nbsp; I've found them to be exciting and interesting, and a far cry from the &quot;roll-and-move&quot; games of my youth.&nbsp; Of course, American games, such as those from Eagle Games and Fantasy Flight, also fascinate me.</p>

<p>Several years ago, I began to write reviews of board games, so that others could find out about these wonderful games.&nbsp; I've also authored an &quot;Interviews by an Optimist&quot; series, a series of interviews with notables in the gaming world, and started a series of deeper board game discussions - Musings On...,which is now gone - but you never know if we might start it up again!<br />
<br />
In May 2005, I started the podcast The Dice Tower with Joe Steadman - a podcast all about board games, and one that has gradually changed over its many episodes.&nbsp; Joe has since left the show, but with a host of other contributors, the Dice Tower is still being produced biweekly, and is one of my favorite things to do.&nbsp; In 2008, I started a video podcast with my daughters, which is amazingly fun!<br />
<br />
Most importantly, I am married to the lovely Laura Vasel, and together we have six beautiful girls - Melody, Amy, Holly, Clara, Violet, and Ruby.&nbsp; We also have a son, Jack, who was called to Heaven in early 2011. &nbsp; Together we served as missionaries in South Korea, where I pastored Uijongbu Baptist Church. &nbsp; I'm now in Homestead, Florida, where I am a math teacher and youth pastor at South Dade Baptist Church. If you ever visit South Florida, feel free to get in touch, and we'll take good care of you!</p>
